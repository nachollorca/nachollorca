## Hola! üëã
My friends call me Nacho (yep, like the tortilla chips üåÆ) and I am Data Scientist from Madrid, now based in Berlin. I am using this GitHub to put together some of the projects I can actually showcase, as a (bit untidy) portfolio. 

To see my CV just check [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/illorca/). Feel free to [write me](mailto:nacho_llorca@outlook.com) with any inquiry!

### üë©‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Cross-corpus NER with German Biomedical Corpora
Part of my Master's Thesis. I created harmonized versions of the four clinical, distributable and annotated datasets in German language. Using the harmonized corpora as a meta-dataset, I performed a total of 340 cross-corpus evaluation experiments to assess the generalization capabilities of current-day pre-trained Transformers on each dataset. The paper was worth a [publication](https://aclanthology.org/2023.clinicalnlp-1.23/) in the _5th Clinical Natural Language Processing Workshop_ of the ACL. 

### [üîç Novel NLP Evaluation Module Implementation for HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/spaces/hpi-dhc/FairEval)
[Katrin Ortmann presented in 2022](https://aclanthology.org/2022.lrec-1.150) a new evaluation method that more accurately reflects true prediction quality for labeled span-based metrics. We thought the idea was fantastic, so I provided an implementation within the HuggingFace Evaluate module to democratize its use. It has already been of help in some workshops and shared tasks as []. Just follow the link to see the code!

### [üì±CLI for a Cross-lingual Medical Entity Linking Toolkit](https://github.com/hpi-dhc/xmen)
I participated in the development of __xMEN__, a python package for cross-lingual (x) Medical Entity Normalization. Mainly, I took care of the [pypi integration](https://pypi.org/project/xmen/), the [Command Line Interface](https://github.com/hpi-dhc/xmen/tree/main/xmen/cli), unit tests and documentation. We used the application for the first time to obtain SOTA results in the _Disease Text Mining Shared Task_ from the Barcelona Supercomputing Center, having the results published in CLEF 2023. 
 
### üïµÔ∏è [Multi-modal Face Anti Spoofing](https://github.com/nachollorca/mm-FAS/tree/main)
I developed an application to detect whether the face in front of the camera is real or fake (a print, a screen...) for a Kiosk manufacturing company. I use a CNN trained separately on RGB, infrared and depth information and test its performance on a self-recorded dataset, paying special attention to the effects of different conditions of room lighting or camera position. The depth model proves to be superior in most scenarios, notably obtaining 0.05 ACER score across all settings. 

### ‚ûó Mathematical Foundations of ML Algorithms
My M. Sc. was very heavy on statistics. I have compiled some interesting implementations I did from scratch of various Machine Learning methods in jupyter notebooks.

### üü¢ Others 
Some other smaller or shared projects.
- üéª __Music Genre Classification__: a fun little project where I attempt to classify songs within 10 music genres discussing different methods, from random forests to simple neural networks. 
- ü¶† __Epidemiological Data Analysis in R-language__: I had access to a sweet German biomedical dataset, so here is a varied statistical analysis I performed to show my R skills.
- üòê __Facial Landmark Detection__: old computer-vision application I developed with a couple of classmates on the use of CNNs to detect facial landmarks (points that define mouth, eyes, nose, eyebrows, etc.) for face recognition.
- üí≤ __Impact of Paid Subscriptions in Physician Platforms__: in 2020, I conducted an investigation with a couple classmates about whether paying a subscription has a significant effect on the ratings of medical physicians in the platform [Jameda](https://www.jameda.de/). 
- üóÉÔ∏è __ETL tools for Master Data Management__: brief literature survey of ETL and MDM with a fictional demonstration of some use cases.
